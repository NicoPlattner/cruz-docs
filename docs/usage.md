# Usage
Hello and thank you for choosing CRUZ Code!
This is the user documentation for CRUZ Code,
a GitHub application developed by the CRUZ Code Team
(Nico Plattner, Ari Ayvazyan, Marlies Kiraly, Rubin Langmann and Ronja Stribick).
This documentation will walk you through the features and perks of our application and how to use CRUZ to its full potential.

## Installation
To install CRUZ Code, go to our [GitHub App page](https://github.com/apps/cruz-code) and click on the ‘install’ button. You then can easily follow the instructions on the screen to add CRUZ to your repository.

## Features and usage
### Automated code reviews
CRUZ automatically reviews your pull requests and focuses on improving your codes performance. As soon as the installation is completed and integrated with your GitHub repository, the code reviewing can start.

The review process starts with a detailed scan through your code looking for any imperfections in the performance of your code. If an imperfection was found, a suggestion within the pull request on how to improve your code is made. CRUZ will always focus on the performance of your code and will therefore make suggestions to improve it.

### Accept or skip
If you agree with CRUZ’s suggestion (and we are sure you will) you simply click the ‘Commit suggestion’ button. The code then gets updated according to the recommendation and you can continue with the next imperfection CRUZ found. In the unlikely case you disagree with a hint you are free to skip it.

## Support
In case you need help or have any further questions about CRUZ Code, we will be happy to help. You can reach us by mail: office.cruzcode@gmail.com

## Updates and Changes
We are constantly looking to improve CRUZ and therefore will regularly release updates. Stay tuned!
